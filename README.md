# Dragon Curve Animation

### What is it?
Long, long ago, my first exercise in recusive programming was to create (and then draw) the [dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve), a relatively simple-to-understand [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal).  Ever since that day, I have been in love with fractals--this one in particular.

These are from the Wikipedia page, just to give you an idea (mine is a little cooler):

In this case, I wanted to create a programmatic animation to liven up my homepage (and learn about manipulating canvas elements with Javascript, of course).  What's cooler than a dragon curve?

### How I did it
In about 60 lines of JavaScript.

### Why?
Why not?

### Where is it?
You can see it in action on my [homepage](http://rossney.net).
